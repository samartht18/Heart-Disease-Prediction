# Heart-Disease-Prediction
The Heart Disease Prediction project is an application developed using Python, specifically leveraging machine learning techniques, and implemented in Jupyter Notebook.
The primary objective of this project was to address the limitations of previous heart disease detection techniques by building an advanced prediction system. 
By employing machine learning algorithms, we aimed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of heart disease detection.
